# Password Generator
# By Alex Cook

This is a password generator by Alex Cook. The purpose of this code is to generate a random password based on criteria sort forth by the user. The two criteria are length and character type.

Once you select the "Generate Password" button, a set of prompts will appear. These prompts will ask the user to specify criteria for the password. Once the user fulfills the criteria prompts, then the password will be generated and displayed on the page.

 Here is the deployed link to the password generator:
